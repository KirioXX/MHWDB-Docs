### Weapon Sharpness
Since [v1.13.0](https://github.com/LartTyler/MHWDB-API/releases/tag/1.13.0), the API provides true sharpness values for
weapons. For each color, sharpness is represented as an integer indicating the number of normal hits the weapon can
make before sharpness degrades (that is to say, the number of hits that did not bounce off of a monster due to the
body part being too hard for the weapon or sharpness level).

All fields in a sharpness object can be found in the table below.

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
red | Integer | The number of normal hits the weapon can make at red sharpness
orange | Integer | The number of normal hits the weapon can make at orange sharpness
yellow | Integer | The number of normal hits the weapon can make at yellow sharpness
green | Integer | The number of normal hits the weapon can make at green sharpness
blue | Integer | The number of normal hits the weapon can make at blue sharpness
white | Integer | The number of normal hits the weapon can make at white sharpness
purple | Integer | The number of normal hits the weapon can make at purple sharpness

In previous versions, these docs provided a simple method for visually representing sharpness values, since they were
represented as percetages (which could be mapped 1:1 to pixels for a 100px wide sharpness bar). You can achieve the
same result by taking the new sharpness values and using the following formula to convert them into their old percetage
value, then flooring the result: <code>&lfloor;sharpness / 400 * 100&rfloor;</code>.

So, for example, the long sword "<a href="https://mhw-db.com/weapons/156" target="_blank">Dark Scimitar 3</a>" has a
base durability of 110 red, 30 orange, 60 yellow, 80 green, 40 blue, 30 white, and 0 purple. This converts to the old
system as follows.

<code>
Red: &lfloor;110 / 400 * 100&rfloor; = 27<br>
Orange: &lfloor;30 / 400 * 100&rfloor; = 7<br>
Yellow: &lfloor;60 / 400 * 100&rfloor; = 15<br>
Green: &lfloor;80 / 400 * 100&rfloor; = 20<br>
Blue: &lfloor;40 / 400 * 100&rfloor; = 10<br>
White: &lfloor;30 / 400 * 100&rfloor; = 7<br>
Purple: &lfloor;0 / 400 * 100&rfloor; = 0
</code>

The resulting bar would look something like the bar below.

<div class="sharpness-bar">
  <div class="red" style="width: 27px"></div>
  <div class="orange" style="width: 7px;"></div>
  <div class="yellow" style="width: 15px;"></div>
  <div class="green" style="width: 20px;"></div>
  <div class="blue" style="width: 10px;"></div>
  <div class="white" style="width: 7px;"></div>
  <div class="purple" style="width: 0px;"></div>

  <div class="clearfix"></div>
</div>

### Weapon Attributes
The weapon attributes object is a dictionary of attribute modifiers attached to a weapon. Most of these fields are planned to be slowly phased out over several releases, and instead provided by specialized fields (such as `sharpness`).

Possible attribute keys are listed below.

---- | ---- | -----------
affinity | Integer | The affinity of the weapon
defense | Integer | Some weapons (namely "gunlance" types) augment player defense; such weapons indicate that with this field
