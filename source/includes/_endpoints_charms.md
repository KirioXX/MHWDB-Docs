# Charms
The API splits charms up into two different objects. The `Charm` object, which is essentially a group of the different levels a charm can be, and the `CharmRank` object, which represents a charm at a particular step in it's upgrade tree. All charms are represented this way, even charms that can't be upgraded.

## Get All Charms
```shell
curl "https://mhw-db.com/charms"
```

```javascript
fetch('https://mhw-db.com/charms')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(charms => {
        // your code here
    });
```

> The command above returns an array of [`Charm`](#charm-fields) objects. Some fields have been truncated for brevity.
